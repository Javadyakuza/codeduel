# Workflow











# Rules

1 - The rival must provide the two sample codes in the rust language(temporary):
    - The solution Code(Executable):

        the solution executable code futures calling function must accessible via the public api of the module.
    - The Usage Trait Object(Executer):
        This code is the order of the function calls of the solution code, this trait object will specify the the solution code developed by the daredevil must contain the trait objects public api function to be called by the the trait object. this code sample must be provided in terms of the `String` as well.
